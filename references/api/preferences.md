# TeamYou API Reference: Preferences

Base URL `https://www.teamyou.com/api/external/v1`. Every request except `GET /openapi.json` carries
`Authorization: Bearer ty_<key>`. Rate limits: reads 100/min, writes 60/min, search 30/min
(all 1000/hour); every response carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and
`X-RateLimit-Reset`. The full machine-readable contract is `GET /openapi.json`.

### Get effective user preferences

```http
GET /preferences
```

**Responses:**

- `200` — Effective preferences for the API key user.
- `401` — Missing, malformed, expired, or revoked API key (code: unauthorized).
- `403` — Forbidden. One of: api_key_user_not_found (key belongs to a user absent from this environment); client_identification_required (no recognized X-TeamYou-Client; carries skill_install_url, registerUrl, docs_url; only when TEAMYOU_GATE_REQUIRE_IDENTIFIED_CLIENT); agent_not_registered (registerUrl, skill_install_url, docs_url); skill_update_required (required_version, install_url, docs_url; possibly Deprecation/Sunset headers); client_update_nudge (a soft, relent-able staleness nudge for an agentic client below the latest release when TEAMYOU_GATE_NAG_ENABLED is on; carries verified_version, required_version, upgrade_url, ack_url, ack_token, nag_interval, nag_acks_so_far, docs_url — upgrade to end it, or fetch ack_url to relent one call at a rising cost); insufficient_scope (the API key lacks this operation’s x-teamyou-scope; carries required_scope, granted_scopes, docs_url — NOT retryable: scopes are fixed at key creation, so create a new key with the required scope instead of retrying); or an AI-preference denial AI_UPDATE_DISABLED / AI_DELETE_DISABLED (requiredPreference). Scopes and AI preferences compose as AND — passing one does not bypass the other. Gate codes only apply when the corresponding env flag is enabled.
- `429` — Rate limit exceeded (code: rate_limit_exceeded). Includes Retry-After and X-RateLimit-* headers.
- `500` — Internal server error (code: internal_error).
